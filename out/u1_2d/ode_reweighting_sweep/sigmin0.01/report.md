Samples drawn from the probability-flow ODE (no charge projection, no
retherm); log q is the density of the ACTUAL samples, so the SNIS and
independence-Metropolis columns are exact estimators of the fine Wilson
target in the n_steps -> inf, exact-divergence limit. At finite
settings two residual biases remain (they shrink with steps/probes,
NOT with more samples): the Heun trapezoid approximates the discrete
map's true log-Jacobian, and Hutchinson noise is unbiased in log q but
biases the exponentiated weights (Jensen). Check stability under
doubled --ode-steps and increased --n-probes (or --n-probes 0) before
quoting. Errors: raw naive sem; i-MH sem inflated by the
low-acceptance autocorrelation factor sqrt((2-a)/a); reweighted
linearized SNIS error. Low ESS/N or i-MH acceptance makes the exact
estimators noisy -- raw columns stay the (biased) high-precision
numbers.
