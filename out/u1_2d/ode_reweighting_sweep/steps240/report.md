Samples drawn from the probability-flow ODE (no charge projection, no
retherm); log q is the density of the ACTUAL samples, so the SNIS and
independence-Metropolis columns are exact estimators of the fine Wilson
target in the n_steps -> inf, exact-divergence limit. At finite
settings two residual biases remain (they shrink with steps/probes,
NOT with more samples): the Heun trapezoid approximates the discrete
map's true log-Jacobian, and Hutchinson noise is unbiased in log q but
biases the exponentiated weights (Jensen). Check stability under
doubled --ode-steps and increased --n-probes (or --n-probes 0) before
quoting. Errors: raw naive sem; i-MH sem inflated by the
low-acceptance autocorrelation factor sqrt((2-a)/a); reweighted
linearized SNIS error. Low ESS/N or i-MH acceptance makes the exact
estimators noisy -- raw columns stay the (biased) high-precision
numbers.

## Free-energy certificate

log E[w] vs the exact character-expansion Delta F
(2 L_f^2 log 2pi + log Z_f - log Z_c). An independent end-to-end
check of the weight chain against the solvable theory; heavy
tails bias the estimate LOW (rare dominant weights undersampled),
so agreement within a few sem certifies, disagreement of tens of
nats quantifies the same density gap the ESS sees.
