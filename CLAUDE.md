Project conventions for AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, etc.) working on InverseRG.

## Project Overview

2D compact U(1) lattice gauge theory with inverse renormalization group.
Currently in Phase 3: forward/inverse RG with a forward hypernetwork, conditioned blocker, and gauge-equivariant coarse-to-fine lifting.

## Key Conventions

### Physics

- Link angles `theta[mu, x, y]` on periodic 2D square lattice, shape `[2, L, L]` or `[B, 2, L, L]`
- `field[:, 0]` = x-links (mu=0), `field[:, 1]` = y-links (mu=1)
- Index convention: `field[batch, mu, x, y]`
- Wilson action: `S = -beta * sum cos(plaquette_angles)`
- Angles always regularized to `[-pi, pi]` via `atan2(sin, cos)`

### Blocking

- Naive 2x2 blocking: sum two consecutive link phases along same direction, then regularize
- Gauge-covariant path blocking: 7 non-backtracking paths per direction within |transverse| <= 1
- Path combination via circular (vector) average with softmax weights
- Blocker types: `NaiveBlocker`, `FixedGaugeCovariantBlocker`, `LearnableGaugeCovariantBlocker`, `SpatialGaugeCovariantBlocker`
- `SpatialGaugeCovariantBlocker`: CNN predicts per-site path logits from gauge-invariant features (12 channels: plaquette + rectangle cosines)
- Coarse lattice is `L/2` from fine lattice `L`
- Tree-level coupling: `beta_c = beta_f / 4` for 2D

### RG Monotone (Phase 2)

- Coupling vector: `J = coarse_action.coefficients`, shape `[d]` where `d = len(basis)`
- RG monotone: MLP `C_theta: R^d -> R`, scalar function over coupling space
- RG flow equation: `dJ/dl = -grad_J C(J)`, one step = one 2x2 blocking
- Flow integration: Euler method; use `create_graph=True` for backprop through the ODE
- Multi-beta training: blocker shared across beta values, `J_coarse` predicted by flow
- 2D U(1) has no phase transition; all flows go toward strong coupling (beta -> 0)
- `torchdiffeq` is an optional dependency (Euler suffices initially)

### Forward/Inverse RG (Phase 3)

- Forward RG hypernetwork: input fine coupling vector `J_f`, output coarse coupling vector `J_c` and blocker code `z_phi`
- `ConditionedSpatialGaugeCovariantBlocker`: shared spatial blocker backbone modulated by `z_phi`
- Inverse proposal net consumes coarse lattice gauge-invariant features, couplings, blocker code, and noise, then predicts gauge-invariant residual coefficients
- Coarse-to-fine lift is constructed as canonical prolongation plus closed-loop residual modes
- Equivariant refinement uses blocker-consistency and fine-action losses; strict gauge-equivariance should come from the construction, not just from training loss

### Code Style

- No comments that merely narrate what code does
- All tensor operations should handle both single `[2, L, L]` and batched `[B, 2, L, L]` inputs
- Use `torch.no_grad()` for measurement computations when not inside training
- Preserve backward compatibility when adding new methods

### Testing

- `pytest tests/` for unit tests
- Example scripts in `examples/` for integration-level checks
- Presentation notebooks in `presentation/` for visual validation

## Virtual Environment

A project-local virtualenv is already set up at `.venv/` (Python 3.11, gitignored).
All dependencies (torch, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, jupyter, pytest) are installed.

**Always use the venv Python** -- never the system `/usr/bin/python3` (which lacks pip and packages):

```bash
# Activate (if running interactively)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Or invoke directly
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q
.venv/bin/jupyter notebook presentation/phase0-naive-pipeline.ipynb
```

The Jupyter kernel `inverserg` is registered for the notebook.

If you need to install additional packages:

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install <package>
```

## Running

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
jupyter notebook presentation/phase0-naive-pipeline.ipynb
pytest tests/ -q
```
